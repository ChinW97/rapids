Your data is adjusted to the specified timezone (multiple timezones suport coming soon ). Flexible day segments . You can extract behavioral features on time windows of any length (e.g. 5 minutes, 3 hours, 2 days), on every day or particular days (e.g. weekends, Mondays, the 1 st of each month, etc.) or around events of interest (e.g. surveys or clinical relapses).

Since this is a Work In Progress this page will be updated with the list of sensors and features for which testing is available. For each of the sensors listed a description of the data used for testing (test cases) are outline. Currently for all intent and testing purposes the tests/data/raw/test01/ contains all the test data files for testing android data formats and tests/data/raw/test02/ contains all the test data files for testing iOS data formats. It follows that the expected (verified output) are contained in the tests/data/processed/test01/ and tests/data/processed/test02/ for Android and iOS respectively. tests/data/raw/test03/ and tests/data/raw/test04/ contain data files for testing empty raw data files for android and iOS respectively. The following is a list of the sensors that testing is currently available. Messages (SMS) \u00b6 The raw message data file contains data for 2 separate days. The data for the first day contains records 5 records for every epoch . The second day's data contains 6 records for each of only 2 epoch (currently morning and evening ) The raw message data contains records for both message_types (i.e. recieved and sent ) in both days in all epochs. The number records with each message_types per epoch is randomly distributed There is at least one records with each message_types per epoch. There is one raw message data file each, as described above, for testing both iOS and Android data. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files Calls \u00b6 Due to the difference in the format of the raw call data for iOS and Android the following is the expected results the calls_with_datetime_unified.csv . This would give a better idea of the use cases being tested since the calls_with_datetime_unified.csv would make both the iOS and Android data comparable. The call data would contain data for 2 days. The data for the first day contains 6 records for every epoch . The second day's data contains 6 records for each of only 2 epoch (currently morning and evening ) The call data contains records for all call_types (i.e. incoming , outgoing and missed ) in both days in all epochs. The number records with each of the call_types per epoch is randomly distributed. There is at least one records with each call_types per epoch. There is one call data file each, as described above, for testing both iOS and Android data. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files Screen \u00b6 Due to the difference in the format of the raw screen data for iOS and Android the following is the expected results the screen_deltas.csv . This would give a better idea of the use cases being tested since the screen_eltas.csv would make both the iOS and Android data comparable These files are used to calculate the features for the screen sensor The screen delta data file contains data for 1 day. The screen delta data contains 1 record to represent an unlock episode that falls within an epoch for every epoch . The screen delta data contains 1 record to represent an unlock episode that falls across the boundary of 2 epochs. Namely the unlock episode starts in one epoch and ends in the next, thus there is a record for unlock episodes that fall across night to morning , morning to afternoon and finally afternoon to night The testing is done for unlock episode_type. There is one screen data file each for testing both iOS and Android data formats. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files Battery \u00b6 Due to the difference in the format of the raw battery data for iOS and Android as well as versions of iOS the following is the expected results the battery_deltas.csv . This would give a better idea of the use cases being tested since the battery_deltas.csv would make both the iOS and Android data comparable. These files are used to calculate the features for the battery sensor. The battery delta data file contains data for 1 day. The battery delta data contains 1 record each for a charging and discharging episode that falls within an epoch for every epoch . Thus, for the daily epoch there would be multiple charging and discharging episodes Since either a charging episode or a discharging episode and not both can occur across epochs, in order to test episodes that occur across epochs alternating episodes of charging and discharging episodes that fall across night to morning , morning to afternoon and finally afternoon to night are present in the battery delta data. This starts with a discharging episode that begins in night and end in morning . There is one battery data file each, for testing both iOS and Android data formats. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files Bluetooth \u00b6 The raw Bluetooth data file contains data for 1 day. The raw Bluetooth data contains at least 2 records for each epoch . Each epoch has a record with a timestamp for the beginning boundary for that epoch and a record with a timestamp for the ending boundary for that epoch . (e.g. For the morning epoch there is a record with a timestamp for 6:00AM and another record with a timestamp for 11:59:59AM . These are to test edge cases) An option of 5 Bluetooth devices are randomly distributed throughout the data records. There is one raw Bluetooth data file each, for testing both iOS and Android data formats. There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files. WIFI \u00b6 There are 2 data files ( wifi_raw.csv and sensor_wifi_raw.csv ) for each fake participant for each phone platform. The raw WIFI data files contain data for 1 day. The sensor_wifi_raw.csv data contains at least 2 records for each epoch . Each epoch has a record with a timestamp for the beginning boundary for that epoch and a record with a timestamp for the ending boundary for that epoch . (e.g. For the morning epoch there is a record with a timestamp for 6:00AM and another record with a timestamp for 11:59:59AM . These are to test edge cases) The wifi_raw.csv data contains 3 records with random timestamps for each epoch to represent visible broadcasting WIFI network. This file is empty for the iOS phone testing data. An option of 10 access point devices is randomly distributed throughout the data records. 5 each for sensor_wifi_raw.csv and wifi_raw.csv . There data files for testing both iOS and Android data formats. There are also additional empty data files for both android and iOS for testing empty data files. Light \u00b6 The raw light data file contains data for 1 day. The raw light data contains 3 or 4 rows of data for each epoch except night . The single row of data for night is for testing features for single values inputs. (Example testing the standard deviation of one input value) Since light is only available for Android there is only one file that contains data for Android. All other files (i.e. for iPhone) are empty data files. Application Foreground \u00b6 The raw application foreground data file contains data for 1 day. The raw application foreground data contains 7 - 9 rows of data for each epoch . The records for each epoch contains apps that are randomly selected from a list of apps that are from the MULTIPLE_CATEGORIES and SINGLE_CATEGORIES (See testing_config.yaml ). There are also records in each epoch that have apps randomly selected from a list of apps that are from the EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES and EXCLUDED_APPS . This is to test that these apps are actually being excluded from the calculations of features. There are also records to test SINGLE_APPS calculations. Since application foreground is only available for Android there is only one file that contains data for Android. All other files (i.e. for iPhone) are empty data files. Activity Recognition \u00b6 The raw Activity Recognition data file contains data for 1 day. The raw Activity Recognition data each epoch period contains rows that records 2 - 5 different activity_types . The is such that durations of activities can be tested. Additionally, there are records that mimic the duration of an activity over the time boundary of neighboring epochs. (For example, there a set of records that mimic the participant in_vehicle from afternoon into evening ) There is one file each with raw Activity Recognition data for testing both iOS and Android data formats. (plugin_google_activity_recognition_raw.csv for android and plugin_ios_activity_recognition_raw.csv for iOS) There is also an additional empty data file for both android and iOS for testing empty data files. Conversation \u00b6 The raw conversation data file contains data for 2 day. The raw conversation data contains records with a sample of both datatypes (i.e. voice/noise = 0 , and conversation = 2 ) as well as rows with for samples of each of the inference values (i.e. silence = 0 , noise = 1 , voice = 2 , and unknown = 3 ) for each epoch . The different datatype and inference records are randomly distributed throughout the epoch . Additionally there are 2 - 5 records for conversations ( datatype = 2, and inference = -1) in each epoch and for each epoch except night, there is a conversation record that has a double_convo_start timestamp that is from the previous epoch . This is to test the calculations of features across epochs . There is a raw conversation data file for both android and iOS platforms ( plugin_studentlife_audio_android_raw.csv and plugin_studentlife_audio_raw.csv respectively). Finally, there are also additional empty data files for both android and iOS for testing empty data files","title":"Test cases"},{"location":"developers/test-cases/#test-cases","text":"Along with the continued development and the addition of new sensors and features to the RAPIDS pipeline, tests for the currently available sensors and features are being implemented.

The data that RAPIDS pipes to your feature extraction code is ready to process. New Features for Existing Sensors \u00b6 You can add new features to any existing sensors (see list below) by adding a new provider in three steps: Modify the config.yaml file Create a provider folder, script and function Implement your features extraction code As a tutorial, we will add a new provider for PHONE_ACCELEROMETER called VEGA that extracts feature1 , feature2 , feature3 in Python and that it requires a parameter from the user called MY_PARAMETER . Existing Sensors An existing sensor is any of the phone or Fitbit sensors with a configuration entry in config.yaml : Phone Accelerometer Phone Activity Recognition Phone Applications Foreground Phone Battery Phone Bluetooth Phone Calls Phone Conversation Phone Light Phone Locations Phone Messages Phone Screen Phone WiFI Connected Phone WiFI Visible Modify the config.yaml file \u00b6 In this step you need to add your provider configuration section under the relevant sensor in config.yaml .

Your provider code should only return the features on this list [MY_PARAMTER] An arbitrary parameter that our example provider VEGA needs. This can be a boolean, integer, float, string or an array of any of such types. [SRC_LANGUAGE] The programming language of your provider script, it can be python or r , in our example python [SRC_FOLDER] The name of your provider in lower case, in our example vega (this will be the name of your folder in the next step) Create a provider folder, script and function \u00b6 In this step you need to add a folder, script and function for your provider. Create your provider folder under src/feature/DEVICE_SENSOR/YOUR_PROVIDER , in our example src/feature/phone_accelerometer/vega (same as [SRC_FOLDER] in the step above). Create your provider script inside your provider folder, it can be a Python file called main.py or an R file called main.R . Add your provider function in your provider script. The name of such function should be [providername]_features , in our example vega_features Python function def [ providername ] _features ( sensor_data_files , day_segment , provider , filter_data_by_segment , * args , ** kwargs ): R function [ providername ] _ features <- function ( sensor_data , day_segment , provider ) Implement your feature extraction code \u00b6 The provider function that you created in the step above will receive the following parameters: Parameter Description sensor_data_files Path to the CSV file containing the data of a single participant. This data has been cleaned and preprocessed. Your function will be automatically called for each participant in your study (in the [PIDS] array in config.yaml ) day_segment The label of the day segment that should be processed. provider The parameters you configured for your provider in config.yaml will be available in this variable as a dictionary in Python or a list in R. In our example this dictionary contains {MY_PARAMETER:\"a_string\"} filter_data_by_segment Python only. A function that you will use to filter your data. In R this function is already available in the environment. *args Python only. Not used for now **kwargs Python only. Not used for now The code to extract your behavioral features should be implemented in your provider function and in general terms it will have three stages: 1. Read a participant\u2019s data by loading the CSV data stored in the file pointed by sensor_data_files acc_data = pd . read_csv ( sensor_data_files [ \"sensor_data\" ]) Note that phone\u2019s battery, screen, and activity recognition data is given as episodes instead of event rows (for example, start and end timestamps of the periods the phone screen was on) 2. Filter your data to process only those rows that belong to day_segment This step is only one line of code, but to undersand why we need it, keep reading. acc_data = filter_data_by_segment ( acc_data , day_segment ) You should use the filter_data_by_segment() function to process and group those rows that belong to each of the day segments RAPIDS could be configured with . Let\u2019s understand the filter_data_by_segment() function with an example. A RAPIDS user can extract features on any arbitrary day segment . A day segment is a period of time that has a label and one or more instances. For example, the user (or you) could have requested features on a daily, weekly, and week-end basis for p01 . The labels are arbritrary and the instances depend on the days a participant was monitored for: the daily segment could be named my_days and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 14 instances the weekly segment could be named my_weeks and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 2 instances. the weekend segment could be named my_weekends and if p01 was monitored for 14 days, it would have 2 instances. For this example, RAPIDS will call your provider function three times for p01 , once where day_segment is my_days , once where day_segment is my_weeks and once where day_segment is my_weekends . In this example not every row in p01 \u2018s data needs to take part in the feature computation for either segment and the rows need to be grouped differently. Thus filter_data_by_segment() comes in handy, it will return a data frame that contains the rows that were logged during a day segment plus an extra column called local_segment . This new column will have as many unique values as day segment instances exist (14, 2, and 2 for our p01 \u2018s my_days , my_weeks , and my_weekends examples). After filtering, you should group the data frame by this column and compute any desired features , for example: acc_features [ \"acc_rapids_maxmagnitude\" ] = acc_data . groupby ([ \"local_segment\" ])[ \"magnitude\" ] . max () The reason RAPIDS does not filter the participant\u2019s data set for you is because your code might need to compute something based on a participant\u2019s complete dataset before computing their features. For example, you might want to identify the number that called a participant the most throughout the study before computing a feature with the number of calls the participant received from this number. 3. Return a data frame with your features After filtering, grouping your data, and computing your features, your provider function should return a data frame that has: One row per day segment instance (e.g. 14 our p01 \u2018s my_days example) The local_segment column added by filter_data_by_segment() One column per feature.

RESAMPLE_FUSED takes the original fused location coordinates and replicates each pair forward in time as long as the phone was sensing data as indicated by PHONE_VALID_SENSED_BINS , this is done because Google's API only logs a new location coordinate pair when it is sufficiently different in time or space from the previous one. There are two parameters associated with resampling fused location. FUSED_RESAMPLED_CONSECUTIVE_THRESHOLD (in minutes, default 30) controls the maximum gap between any two coordinate pairs to replicate the last known pair (for example, participant A's phone did not collect data between 10.30am and 10:50am and between 11:05am and 11:40am, the last known coordinate pair will be replicated during the first period but not the second, in other words, we assume that we cannot longer guarantee the participant stayed at the last known location if the phone did not sense data for more than 30 minutes). FUSED_RESAMPLED_TIME_SINCE_VALID_LOCATION (in minutes, default 720 or 12 hours) stops the last known fused location from being replicated longer that this threshold even if the phone was sensing data continuously (for example, participant A went home at 9pm and their phone was sensing data without gaps until 11am the next morning, the last known location will only be replicated until 9am).

Home is the most visited significant location between 8 pm and 8 am including any pauses within a 200-meter radius. disttravelled meters Total distance travelled over a day (flights). rog meters The Radius of Gyration (rog) is a measure in meters of the area covered by a person over a day. A centroid is calculated for all the places (pauses) visited during a day and a weighted distance between all the places and that centroid is computed. The weights are proportional to the time spent in each place. maxdiam meters The maximum diameter is the largest distance between any two pauses. maxhomedist meters The maximum distance from home in meters. siglocsvisited locations The number of significant locations visited during the day. Significant locations are computed using k-means clustering over pauses found in the whole monitoring period. The number of clusters is found iterating k from 1 to 200 stopping until the centroids of two significant locations are within 400 meters of one another. avgflightlen meters Mean length of all flights. stdflightlen meters Standard deviation of the length of all flights. avgflightdur seconds Mean duration of all flights. stdflightdur seconds The standard deviation of the duration of all flights. probpause - The fraction of a day spent in a pause (as opposed to a flight) siglocentropy nats Shannon\u2019s entropy measurement based on the proportion of time spent at each significant location visited during a day. circdnrtn - A continuous metric quantifying a person\u2019s circadian routine that can take any value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a daily routine completely different from any other sensed days and 1 a routine the same as every other sensed day. wkenddayrtn - Same as circdnrtn but computed separately for weekends and weekdays. Assumptions/Observations Barnett's et al features These features are based on a Pause-Flight model. A pause is defined as a mobiity trace (location pings) within a certain duration and distance (by default 300 seconds and 60 meters). A flight is any mobility trace between two pauses. Data is resampled and imputed before the features are computed. See Barnett et al for more information. In RAPIDS we only expose two parameters for these features (timezone and accuracy limit). You can change other parameters in src/features/phone_locations/barnett/library/MobilityFeatures.R . Significant Locations Significant locations are determined using K-means clustering on pauses longer than 10 minutes. The number of clusters (K) is increased until no two clusters are within 400 meters from each other. After this, pauses within a certain range of a cluster (200 meters by default) will count as a visit to that significant location.

[DBSCAN_MINSAMPLES] The number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point of a cluster. This includes the point itself. [THRESHOLD_STATIC] It is the threshold value in km/hr which labels a row as Static or Moving. [MAXIMUM_GAP_ALLOWED] The maximum gap (in seconds) allowed between any two consecutive rows for them to be considered part of the same displacement. If this threshold is too high, it can throw speed and distance calculations off for periods when the the phone was not sensing. [MINUTES_DATA_USED] Set to True to include an extra column in the final location feature file containing the number of minutes used to compute the features on each day segment. Use this for quality control purposes, the more data minutes exist for a period, the more reliable its features should be.

The number of clusters is found iterating k from 1 to 200 stopping until the centroids of two significant locations are within 400 meters of one another. avgflightlen meters Mean length of all flights. stdflightlen meters Standard deviation of the length of all flights. avgflightdur seconds Mean duration of all flights. stdflightdur seconds The standard deviation of the duration of all flights. probpause - The fraction of a day spent in a pause (as opposed to a flight) siglocentropy nats Shannon\u2019s entropy measurement based on the proportion of time spent at each significant location visited during a day. circdnrtn - A continuous metric quantifying a person\u2019s circadian routine that can take any value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a daily routine completely different from any other sensed days and 1 a routine the same as every other sensed day. wkenddayrtn - Same as circdnrtn but computed separately for weekends and weekdays. Assumptions/Observations Barnett's et al features These features are based on a Pause-Flight model. A pause is defined as a mobiity trace (location pings) within a certain duration and distance (by default 300 seconds and 60 meters). A flight is any mobility trace between two pauses. Data is resampled and imputed before the features are computed. See Barnett et al for more information. In RAPIDS we only expose two parameters for these features (timezone and accuracy limit). You can change other parameters in src/features/phone_locations/barnett/library/MobilityFeatures.R . Significant Locations Significant locations are determined using K-means clustering on pauses longer than 10 minutes. The number of clusters (K) is increased until no two clusters are within 400 meters from each other. After this, pauses within a certain range of a cluster (200 meters by default) will count as a visit to that significant location.

[DBSCAN_MINSAMPLES] The number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point of a cluster. This includes the point itself. [THRESHOLD_STATIC] It is the threshold value in km/hr which labels a row as Static or Moving. [MAXIMUM_GAP_ALLOWED] The maximum gap (in seconds) allowed between any two consecutive rows for them to be considered part of the same displacement. If this threshold is too high, it can throw speed and distance calculations off for periods when the the phone was not sensing. [MINUTES_DATA_USED] Set to True to include an extra column in the final location feature file containing the number of minutes used to compute the features on each day segment. Use this for quality control purposes, the more data minutes exist for a period, the more reliable its features should be. For fused location, a single minute can contain more than one coordinate pair if the participant is moving fast enough. [SAMPLING_FREQUENCY] Expected time difference between any two location rows in minutes. If set to 0 , the sampling frequency will be inferred automatically as the median of all the differences between any two consecutive row timestamps (recommended if you are using FUSED_RESAMPLED data).

For example, you might want to process data on every day, every morning, or only during weekends. RAPIDS offers three categories of day segments that are flexible enough to cover most use cases: frequency (short time windows every day), periodic (arbitrary time windows on any day), and event (arbitrary time windows around events of interest). See also our examples . Frequency Segments These segments are computed on every day and all have the same duration (for example 30 minutes).

Column Description label A string that is used as a prefix in the name of your day segments length An integer representing the duration of your day segments in minutes Example label,length thirtyminutes,30 This configuration will compute 48 day segments for every day when any data from any participant was sensed. For example: start_time,length,label 00:00,30,thirtyminutes0000 00:30,30,thirtyminutes0001 01:00,30,thirtyminutes0002 01:30,30,thirtyminutes0003 ... Periodic Segments These segments can be computed every day, or on specific days of the week, month, quarter, and year. Their minimum duration is 1 minute but they can be as long as you want. Set the following keys in your config.yaml . DAY_SEGMENTS : &day_segments TYPE : PERIODIC FILE : \"data/external/your_periodic_segments.csv\" INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS : FALSE # or TRUE If [INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS] is set to TRUE , RAPIDS will consider instances of your segments back enough in the past as to include the first row of data of each participant. For example, if the first row of data from a participant happened on Saturday March 7 th 2020 and the requested segment duration is 7 days starting on every Sunday, the first segment to be considered would start on Sunday March 1 st if [INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS] is TRUE or on Sunday March 8 th if FALSE .

It has to be unique between rows start_time A string with format HH:MM:SS representing the starting time of this segment on any day length A string representing the length of this segment.It can have one or more of the following strings XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent days, hours, minutes and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S repeats_on One of the follow options every_day , wday , qday , mday , and yday . The last four represent a week, quarter, month and year day repeats_value An integer complementing repeats_on . If you set repeats_on to every_day set this to 0 , otherwise 1-7 represent a wday starting from Mondays, 1-31 represent a mday , 1-91 represent a qday , and 1-366 represent a yday Example label,start_time,length,repeats_on,repeats_value daily,00:00:00,23H 59M 59S,every_day,0 morning,06:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 afternoon,12:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 evening,18:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 night,00:00:00,5H 59M 59S,every_day,0 This configuration will create five segments instances ( daily , morning , afternoon , evening , night ) on any given day ( every_day set to 0). The daily segment will start at midnight and will last 23:59:59 , the other four segments will start at 6am, 12pm, 6pm, and 12am respectively and last for 05:59:59 . Event segments These segments can be computed before or after an event of interest (defined as any UNIX timestamp). Their minimum duration is 1 minute but they can be as long as you want. The start of each segment can be shifted backwards or forwards from the specified timestamp. Set the following keys in your config.yaml . DAY_SEGMENTS : &day_segments TYPE : EVENT FILE : \"data/external/your_event_segments.csv\" INCLUDE_PAST_PERIODIC_SEGMENTS : FALSE # or TRUE The file pointed by [DAY_SEGMENTS][FILE] should have the following format and can have multiple rows. Column Description label A string that is used as a prefix in the name of your day segments. If labels are unique, every segment is independent; if two or more segments have the same label, their data will be grouped when computing features like the most frequent contact for calls (the most frequent contact will be computed across all these segments) event_timestamp A UNIX timestamp that represents the moment an event of interest happened (clinical relapse, survey, readmission, etc.). The corresponding day segment will be computed around this moment using length , shift , and shift_direction length A string representing the length of this segment. It can have one or more of the following keys XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent a number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S shift A string representing the time shift from event_timestamp . It can have one or more of the following keys XXD XXH XXM XXS to represent a number of days, hours, minutes and seconds. For example 7D 23H 59M 59S . Use this value to change the start of a segment with respect to its event_timestamp . For example, set this variable to 1H to create a segment that starts 1 hour from an event of interest ( shift_direction determines if it\u2019s before or after). shift_direction An integer representing whether the shift is before ( -1 ) or after ( 1 ) an event_timestamp device_id The device id (smartphone or fitbit) to whom this segment belongs to. You have to create a line in the event segment file for each event of a participant that you want to analyse Example label,event_timestamp,length,shift,shift_direction,device_id stress1,1587661220000,1H,5M,1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress2,1587747620000,4H,4H,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress3,1587906020000,3H,5M,1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress4,1584291600000,7H,4H,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 stress5,1588172420000,9H,5M,-1,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587661220000,1H,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587747620000,1D,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 mood,1587906020000,7D,0,0,a748ee1a-1d0b-4ae9-9074-279a2b6ba524 This example will create eight segments for a single participant ( a748ee1a... ), five independent stressX segments with various lengths (1,4,3,7, and 9 hours). Segments stress1 , stress3 , and stress5 are shifted forwards by 5 minutes and stress2 and stress4 are shifted backwards by 4 hours (that is, if the stress4 event happened on March 15 th at 1pm EST ( 1584291600000 ), the day segment will start on that day at 9am and end at 4pm). The three mood segments are 1 hour, 1 day and 7 days long and have no shift. In addition, these mood segments are grouped together, meaning that although RAPIDS will compute features on each one of them, some necessary information to compute a few of such features will be extracted from all three segments, for example the phone contact that called a participant the most or the location clusters visited by a participant. Segment Examples \u00b6 Device Data Source Configuration \u00b6 You might need to modify the following config keys in your config.yaml depending on what devices your participants used and where you are storing your data. Hint You can ignore [DEVICE_DATA][PHONE] or [DEVICE_DATA][FITBIT] if you are not working with either devices.

Forcing a complete rerun If you want to update your data from your database or rerun the whole pipeline from scratch run one or both of the following commands depending on the devices you are using: ./rapids -j1 -R download_phone_data ./rapids -j1 -R download_fitbit_data Deleting RAPIDS output If you want to delete all the output files RAPIDS produces you can execute the following command (the content of these folders will be deleted: data/raw , data/interim , data/processed , reports/figures , and reports/compliance ) ./rapids -j1 -R clean Ready to extract behavioral features If you are ready to extract features head over to the Behavioral Features Introduction","title":"Execution"},{"location":"setup/execution/#execution","text":"After you have installed and configured RAPIDS, use the following command to execute it. ./rapids -j1 Info The script ./rapids is a wrapper around Snakemake so you can pass any parameters that Snakemake accepts (e.g. -j1 ). Updating RAPIDS output after modifying config.yaml Any changes to the config.yaml file will be applied automatically and only the relevant files will be updated. This means that after modifying the features list for PHONE_MESSAGE for example, RAPIDS will update the output file with the correct features. Multi-core You can run RAPIDS over multiple cores by modifying the -j argument (e.g. use -j8 to use 8 cores). However , take into account that this means multiple sensor datasets for different participants will be load in memory at the same time.
